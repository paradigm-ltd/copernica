# Copernica

RPC (HATEOAS) actions on a universally addressable public key.

Copernica is a transport agnostic overlay, privacy preserving, Information-centric, IP replacement, networking protocol. Just as Bitcoin separates money and state, so Copernica separates your data from -FAANG- state.

This crate contains the needed type and functions to allow for the implementation of Protocols.

A protocol typically is an application protocol, very similar to SMTP, NNTP and other types of protocols.
I'm uncertain whether this crate should be the repository for a number of building block protocols that can be combined together in a Service layer abstraction, or simply expose just the needed traits to allow others to implement protocols which can be imported as needed.
